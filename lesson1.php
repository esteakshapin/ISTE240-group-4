    Most users who grew up following the turn of the century are primarily familiar with a Graphical User Interface, or GUI. Using input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen, a user can interact with their system in more intuitive and visual ways compared to a Command Line Interface, or CLI. The most common desktop operating systems for personal use are Windows and Mac OS, which both use a GUI for nearly all of their system functions. When interacting with Unix or a Unix-based operating system such as Linux, there’s often a greater emphasis on CLI interfaces. This occurs for a variety of reasons such as quicker access to system functions without wasting time navigating menus and submenus, as well as using less system resources rendering window effects and animations. The transition from GUI to CLI can be extremely daunting, especially for those who’ve grown accustomed to Windows or Mac, but once you learn the commands many find CLI to actually be quicker to navigate since you don’t have to click through so many menus and get lost in a control panel full of settings. Once you become familiar with a few basic commands, you’ll never be able to go back to fiddling with windows control panel settings again!
